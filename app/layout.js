    'This Notes App is a modern, responsive web application designed to help users efficiently manage their notes with a priority-based organization system. Built with React (Next.js) and Tailwind CSS, the app features a clean, intuitive interface that supports creating, editing, and deleting notes, each categorized into three priority levels â€” Urgent, High, and Low. Users can register, log in, and manage their notes in real time, with changes reflected instantly without page reloads. The application is integrated with a MockAPI backend for persistent storage and offers additional features like grid/list view switching, responsive layouts for mobile and desktop, and smooth animations for an enhanced user experience.',
